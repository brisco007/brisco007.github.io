GiantVM is the state of the art distributed hypervisor (VEE 2020) which is based on KVM. It allows to start a guest OS whose CPU and memory are provided by several physical machines. In this paper, we study the origin of performance overhead of GiantVM – which is the DSM, hence, in term of number of page faults. Then we propose several optimizations which allow to improve performances by about 39%. Moreover, based on our study and proposed optimizations,
we laid out guidelines to build a distributed hypervisor that is independent and flexible – easy to evolve, from a distributed shared memory (DSM) system.
