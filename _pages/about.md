I am pursuiing a PhD thesis in Virtualization and virtual machines security at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), i started in April 2023. This PhD is under the direction of Pr [Alain TCHANA](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/) and Dr [Renaud Lachaize](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/rlachaiz/). It is a CIFRE thesis which means that it is done in partnership with a company in France. The comppany where I am working at is Orange Innovation of the [Orange Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/orange/). My company supervisor is [kahina Lazri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kahina-lazri/?trk=public_profile_browsemap&originalSubdomain=fr). My work is mainly about building a framework for virtual machine observation; to make virtual machines introspection (VMI) to fill the semantic gap and perform a seamless observation of a target machine.

I already have some experience in virtualization. 
First, When I was in M1, at the [National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaoundé](https://polytechnique.cm/) I did an internship, working on the synchromization of a distributed shared memory (DSM), in [GiantVM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381052.3381324), a virtual machine monitor (VMM) developed at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This internship was under the supervision of Pr [Alain TCHANA](). I have implemented a write-protect algorithm in it. and performed some other optimizations. The main goal of that topic was to perform  a study of the implementation of a distrubuted hypervisor, on the memory management part. This has led to a publication in a workshop named [SPMA(Systems for Post-Moore Architectures)](https://sites.google.com/view/spma22eurosys/home) colocated with Eurosys 2022. The paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVcswD44EEXhFoa0gMwYY87t5PHzHZxY/view?usp=sharing).

In My second year of master thesis at Yaoundé, i wørked on the performance optimizaition of a distributed hypervisor developped in the laboratory where I worked at: [Laboratoire d'Informatique du Parallélisme](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/). That Hypervisor is called Scalevisor. it was under the supervision of alain TCHANA. 

I Hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en) that I did in 2021-2022. The internship that I did there was about the Virtualization of a novel PIM (Processing-In-Memory) hardware, developped by [UPMEM](), a Grenoble startup. It is the first commercially usable PIM hardware available. I worked on the virtualization of such a hardware to make it usable in the cloud for everyone. 
This project is still undergoing. 

I have a Bachelor's Degree equivalent in Computer Engineering from the [The National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaounde, Cameroon](https://www.polytechnique.cm/)
